# Uxn implementation in WebAssembly

[![Build](https://github.com/remko/uxn.wasm/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/remko/uxn.wasm/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This is an implementation of the [Uxn](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) virtual
machine in WebAssembly. It provides a drop-in replacement for the
[uxn5](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn5) vanilla JS core.

The [WebAssembly
module](https://github.com/remko/uxn.wasm/blob/master/src/uxn.wat) is generated
by [a script](https://github.com/remko/uxn.wasm/blob/master/scripts/emuwasm.js) that generates WebAssembly for the various instruction variants, based on hand-written raw WebAssembly for the base instructions, and does some small local optimizations on the generated code.

Goals of this implementation (in descending order of priority) are:

- **Compliance**: Follows the Uxn specification to the letter. This includes
  support for circular stacks and memory, which comes at the cost of speed (and
  simplicity). Compliance is [tested](https://github.com/remko/uxn.wasm/actions/workflows/upstream-tests.yml) against the [Uxn opcode test suite](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn-utils/tree/main/item/cli/opctest).
- **Simplicity**: The implementation needs to be understandable and maintainable.
  When speed optimizations would come at the cost of too much complexity, I
  donâ€™t do them.
- **Speed**: Try to be as fast as possible. If implementation of instructions are
  changed, check the impact on performance of the benchmarks (and
  microbenchmarks) to understand the impact on speed.

See [this blog post](https://mko.re/blog/uxn-wasm/) for some context,
implementation details, and benchmarks.

## Installation

Uxn.wasm is part of the uxn5 distribution.
If you want to install a different version:

1. Download `uxn-wasm.js` from [the Releases page](https://github.com/remko/uxn.wasm/releases).
2. Put `uxn-wasm.js` in the `src/` dir of [uxn5](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/uxn5).
3. Open uxn5 `index.html`, and check your browser JavaScript console that it loaded the WebAssembly core.


## Using Uxn.wasm in JavaScript

You can use the core outside of uxn5, as a standalone way to run Uxn programs.
This package ships with extra utilities under the `util` submodule to easily run Uxn
programs, including an Uxntal assembler (`asm`), and utility devices (e.g. a `LogConsole` 
console device that logs output to `console`).

### Example

The example below runs a Uxntal program to compute prime numbers below 65536, and writes
them to the console. 

```javascript
import { Uxn } from "uxn.wasm";
import { asm, mux, LogConsole } from "uxn.wasm/util";

(async () => {
  const uxn = new Uxn();

  // Initialize the system with 1 device: a console at device offset 0x10 that
  // logs output using `console.log`.
  await uxn.init(mux(uxn, { 0x10: new LogConsole() }));

  // Assemble the program written in Uxntal assembly language into a binary ROM 
  // using `asm`, and load it into the core.
  uxn.load(
    asm(`
